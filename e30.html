							<p>In Morocco, the second generation of the BMW 3 Series was unveiled. The key innovation: Seven different variants, with sedan-oriented styling dominant in all versions. In 1982, the new 3 Series was launched as a two-door sedan, with the four-door sedan available from September 1983 onwards. All of the second-generation models produced had series-standard twin headlights – a design feature that was to be included in every BMW 3 Series from then on.</p>
							<p><strong>From the Road to the Racetrack<br></strong> The BMW 3 Series convertible and the first BMW M3 models followed just two years later. The high-performance coupé, boasting performance of up to 238 hp, allowed BMW to take part in the German Touring Car Championship (DTM). As a “homologated” model, the BMW M3 was approved by motorsport authorities to compete in races.</p>

							<p><strong>The Touring “Hobby” Project<br></strong>Having started life as a prototype built by BMW employee Max Reisböck, the first Touring was added to the series in 1987. Reisböck wanted to take his family on vacation but found that the trunk of the BMW 3 Series sedan with its notchback design lacked the space required. As a trained bodywork engineer, Reisböck cut the C-column and shifted it to the rear, thereby creating the first-ever station wagon offered by BMW. </p>
