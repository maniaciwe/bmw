							<p>The third generation of the BMW 3 Series represented one of the most significant design advances in its history to date. The formal language was much more coupé-oriented, with a strongly sloping A-line and C-line. The angle of the roof now had a clear downward incline. And the third-generation vehicles were also notable for the twin headlamps installed beneath a shared glass cover.</p>
							<p><strong>Eight Variants of the 3 Series<br></strong> The third-generation of the BMW 3 Series comprised the widest range of body styles to date, including the Sedan, Coupé, Convertible, Touring, Compact, and M3 – the latter as a Sedan, Coupé, or Convertible.</p>

							<p><strong>Compact Hatchback</strong><br>
							The BMW 3 Series Compact represented something brand new in the range. This new variant was launched in March 1994 as a more compact three-door hatchback option. While the front of the vehicle was no different from the other models, the rear end had a unique design and was 22.5 cm shorter than the Coupé. The BMW 3 Series Compact was well received, moving from a standing start to become the model with the third-highest sales, behind the Sedan and the Coupé.</p>
