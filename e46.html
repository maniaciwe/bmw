							<p>The year 1997 also saw the launch of the fourth generation of the BMW 3 Series. Just as before, the Sedan was the first model to be released, followed by the Coupé, Convertible, Touring, Compact, and M3. For the first time, significant styling differences were evident within the range, with the Coupé, Convertible, and Compact models each having their own language of form.</p>

							<p><strong>The Greenhouse as a Driver of Sales</strong><br>Particularly with its profile, the fourth-generation BMW 3 Series reinterpreted elements of BMW sedan design. The three-box design was retained (with its clear delineation between the hood, passenger compartment, and trunk). However, the whole greenhouse – in other words, the windshield, the rear and side windows, the pillars separating them, and the car’s roof – was redesigned. Seen from the side, the profile of the roof was given a more pronounced curve. This created more headroom for the passengers in back. The new design changes were a success: With 3,266,885 units sold, the fourth generation of the BMW 3 Series is the top-selling BMW model of all time.</p>
